## My Laravel application --- php & javascript!
Hi there! This is my first project written with the help of Laravel framework. 
This site is a regular blog with several articles.

### I used the following tools to write it: 
1. php 7.4
2. MariaDB 10.5 - is database. Mariadb on InnoDB engine.
3. laravel 8* 
4. axios lib for api ajax-requests.
5. for the database administration I used phpmyadmin.
6. bootstrap 5 for style (awesome) 
7. faker - for creating pseudo-articles, comments, views and likes (all states)
8. Vue 3 - for frontend part. + lib Vuex.
9. apache 2.4 is webserver

Soon I'll deploy it on my domain with the help of docker! I'm going to add here Dockerfiles and all config files.
